# SQL-E-Commerce-Data-Analysis
This project demonstrates how to use SQL for analyzing an e-commerce database by performing various operations including filtering, joining, aggregation, subqueries, and view creation.

1. Querying Data

Filtered data using SELECT, WHERE, and sorted with ORDER BY

Grouped data using GROUP BY to summarize order counts by country

2. Joins

INNER JOIN to match customers with their orders

LEFT JOIN to include all customers (even those with no orders)

RIGHT JOIN (via reversed LEFT JOIN) to list all orders with associated customer details

3. Aggregate Functions

Calculated total revenue (SUM)

Measured average order value (AVG)

Analyzed revenue by product category

4. Subqueries

Identified high-spending customers

Fetched the product with the highest price

5. View Creation

Created a reusable view MonthlyCustomerOrderSummary to monitor:

Monthly customer signups

Order count

Total revenue over time
